### Constitutional Trait Family and Proof-Emission Upgrade

**Document:** [AMENABLE_PLAN.md](AMENABLE_PLAN.md)

**Status:** 🔲 Planning — core trait family implemented, certification
architecture now split between abstract core traits and concrete std-backed
registrations, proof-emission machinery not yet started

**Description:** `amenable` is the foundational, dependency-light crate
defining the trait family for lawful proof-carrying software structure.
Formal verification does not depend on elicitation or any other downstream
framework; those frameworks depend on `amenable`. The core constitutional
traits (`Verifier`, `Witness`, `Evidence`, `Standard`, `Provenance`,
`Certificate`, `Registry`, `Sidecar`, `Establish`, `Exchange`,
`StateMachine`, `Amenable`) have been relocated here from an incubation
module inside `elicitation`. The current design direction is: abstract trait
interfaces in `amenable_core`, concrete std-backed provenance/certification
registrations in `amenable_std`, and explicit wrapper carriers for lawful
std-lib `Standard` registrations. Remaining work: proof-quality heuristics
on `Witness`, full certification artifact plumbing, and a from-scratch
upgrade of the proof-emission machinery (the successor to `elicitation`'s
`Prop`/`Established<P>`/`ProvableFrom<C>`/`VerifiedStateMachine`), after
which `elicitation` becomes a consumer of this crate rather than an
independent proof-carrying framework.

**Architecture principle:** `amenable` defines upstream architectural law.
Every `Evidence`-bearing claim is backed by either a genuine machine-checked
proof or an explicit provenance-backed `Standard` certification — never a
blanket impl that grants trust for free.
