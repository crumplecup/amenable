//! `CreusotWitness` impls for Rust standard-library carriers.
//!
//! This lives here, not alongside the proof functions in `amenable_creusot`,
//! because `creusot-rustc`'s translator sweeps every local item in a
//! `creusot-std`-dependent crate — including ones no `#[cfg(creusot)]` gate
//! protects, since Rust items don't need to *run* to be enumerated. Ordinary
//! infrastructure that's completely unremarkable to plain `rustc` turned out
//! to be unsupported there: a return-position `impl Trait` on a local `impl`
//! panicked its intrinsics-gathering pass outright (a real ICE, not a
//! hypothetical), and the `static` item `::inventory::submit!` expands to
//! hit "unsupported definition kind ... Static" the same way. So
//! `amenable_creusot` stays pure Pearlite proof-function content — the thing
//! `cargo creusot -- -p amenable_creusot` actually needs to translate — and
//! everything else about *finding* those proofs (the witness bridge, the
//! registry) moves to the crate that already owns the types being proved
//! about.
//!
//! This is legal under Rust's orphan rule for a reason distinct from every
//! other verifier backend's bridge (see `amenable_creusot::witness`'s own
//! doc comment for the usual justification: the verifier marker type is
//! local): here, `RustStdStandard<T>` — the `Self` type — is local to this
//! crate instead. The orphan rule only requires *one* of {trait, Self type,
//! trait's own type parameters} to be local to the implementing crate, not
//! any particular one, and a real 3-crate test confirmed a Self-type-local
//! justification compiles exactly the same as a trait-parameter-local one.
//!
//! One block per concrete type: a Creusot-checkable property doesn't
//! generalize across types the way provenance does, so there is no blanket
//! impl here — each type gets exactly the contract that's actually true of
//! it. The bridge to `Witness<CreusotVerifier>` is mechanical (delegates
//! straight to `CreusotWitness`), so it's generated per type by a macro
//! rather than hand-repeated.
//!
//! Most of these carriers have no invariant beyond what the type system
//! already guarantees — every bit pattern of an `i8` is a valid `i8`, so
//! there is nothing for Creusot to check. Their `proof()` is trusted: it
//! returns the chain-derived provenance reached through
//! `SupportingEvidence::basis().audit()` and nothing more — not a special
//! case, just what a `proof()` implementation looks like when there's no
//! contract content to add. `char` and `String` do carry a genuine
//! constraint, so their `proof()` also names the Creusot contract function
//! that checks it, alongside the same chain-derived provenance.
//!
//! Each type also registers a [`amenable_core::ProofRecord`] alongside its
//! `Witness` bridge, so `proof()`'s output is discoverable by name for
//! audit — see `amenable_core::chain::proof_chain`. The registered
//! `evidence` name is a hardcoded module-path literal matching
//! `RustStdStandard`'s own registration in `rust_std`, so both sides agree
//! on the same string without one computing it from the other.
//!
//! A "checked" carrier's [`CheckedProof::claim`] is the contract's own
//! verbatim source (`#[requires]`/`#[ensures]` included), captured via
//! [`amenable_derive::harness!`] *in `amenable_creusot`* — this crate only
//! imports the resulting `&'static str` constant, never the harness
//! function itself, so the claim can never drift from the real contract
//! without also touching the crate that's actually translated.
